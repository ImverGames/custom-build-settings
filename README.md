Introduction

This documentation describes the process of creating custom plugins for the build settings editor window in Unity.

Core Components
IBuildPluginEditor Interface

All custom plugins must implement the IBuildPluginEditor interface. This interface includes the following methods:

    InvokeSetupPlugin: Plugin initialization.
    InvokeOnFocusPlugin: Actions when the plugin is focused.
    InvokeGUIPlugin: Rendering of the user interface.
    InvokeDestroyPlugin: Cleanup of plugin resources.

BuildIncrementorData Class

This class is used for storing and transferring data between the plugin and the build settings editor.
BuildValue<T> Class

BuildValue<T> is a generic class used for storing values and tracking their changes in the editor.

Creating Your Own Plugin

To create your own plugin:

    Implement IBuildPluginEditor: Create a class that implements IBuildPluginEditor.
    Initialize Data: Initialize necessary data in InvokeSetupPlugin.
    Implement UI: Create a user interface in InvokeGUIPlugin.
    Handle Events: Add handlers for value changes or other user actions.
    Clean Up Resources: Ensure all event subscriptions and used resources are cleaned up in InvokeDestroyPlugin.

Conclusion
